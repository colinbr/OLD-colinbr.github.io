  <h2>Rising Sign is in	07 Degrees: Scorpio</h2>
  <p>You tend to be quiet, reserved, secretive and, at times, quite difficult to understand. 
    Others notice your deep emotions and feelings and wonder how to draw you out. 
    Stubborn and tough, you fight for any position you believe in. 
    You are very resourceful and formidable when you become angered or upset about something. 
    You enjoy living life at the cutting edge -- for you life must be experienced intensely and totally. 
    Quite courageous, you are willing to take calculated risks. 
    Easily hurt by others, you often strike back with bitter sarcasm. 
    Sensitive and curious, you are concerned with the deeper mysteries of human psychology. 
    Once you have become interested in any subject, you pursue it with total fanaticism.</p> 

<h2>Sun is in	21 Degrees: Sagittarius.</h2> 
<p>Very fun-loving, spirited and energetic, you have a huge reservoir of physical energy within you that needs to be released. 
  As such, exercise or sports are very important to you. 
  Quite gregarious, you enjoy being with other people, but you tend to avoid emotionally restrictive or intimate relationships. 
  Constantly curious about the broader issues of life, you may at times be quite careless and sloppy about details -- you tend to leap to conclusions before all the facts are in. An avid reader, you are totally enthusiastic about any given subject should it interest you. You are known for being idealistic, generous, sociable, cheerful and very positive!</p> 

<h2>Moon is in	16 Degrees: Aquarius.</h2> 
<p>Very freedom-oriented, you must always be able to do what you wish, no matter what. You become stubborn and recalcitrant when others try to force you into a mold. You are a true democrat -- you are not a follower, but you enjoy being with those who are like-minded. You appreciate emotional self-control -- you practice it yourself and you look for it in others. You solve problems, including emotional ones, with your brains and intellect, not your feelings. Try to be tolerant of those who have powerful and obvious emotional responses -- not everyone is as objective, cool, dispassionate and detached as you are.</p> 

<h2>Mercury is in 28 Degrees: Sagittarius.</h2> 
<p>Your mind is very curious and inquisitive, always seeking information on a wide variety of topics. The broader the subject matter (philosophy, science, religion, metaphysics), the more it will appeal to you. You prefer to deal with abstractions -- the small but important details associated with any subject tend to slip your grasp. You are known for being blunt, honest and truthful.</p> 

<h2>Venus is in	24 Degrees: Scorpio.</h2> 
<p>Your feelings about others are deep, powerful, intense and complex. When you like someone, you do so totally and obsessively if you do not like someone, they do not exist. Your faithfulness and loyalty to your lover is unquestioned, indeed at times it is too much so -- you get so possessive that you almost smother your partner. At times, your feelings are kept deep within you and, because they are so complex and intense, they frighten you -- this is the way that you try to ignore them. But the more you try to do this, the more explosive things get when you eventually do express them.</p> 

<h2>Mars is in 11 Degrees: Aries.</h2> 
<p>You are very independent and self-assertive, and you have lots of physical energy. You are not satisfied unless you can be the first to do something. As such, you are more comfortable in leadership positions than you are as an underling. When you are challenged by anyone for anything, you delight in the competitive process and will fight long and hard for your beliefs. You are bold and courageous and often act without thinking. At times, in your zeal to get ahead, you are tactless and offensive -- learn that cooperation with others can often bring you nearer to your goals quicker because of the support you will get.</p> 

<h2>Jupiter is in 28 Degrees: Taurus.</h2> 
<p>Growth only occurs for you after you have found a stable lifestyle and a dependable, protective and secure environment. You are at your best when those around you provide you with a great deal of affection and support. When you feel insecure or threatened, you tend to become possessive and grasping and self- indulgent. You are an inveterate collector with an expensive preference for all the good things that life has to offer.</p>

<h2>Saturn is in 03 Degrees: Capricorn.</h2> 
<p>Very serious-minded and mature, you have the ability to take on responsibilities and to carry out important duties. You can also be trusted to be extremely practical and thrifty. A good organizer, you are the ideal one to be counted on to take a clearly defined project through to its logical conclusion. An achiever, you pride yourself on your ability to focus your attention totally on some worthy goal and then attain it.</p> 

<h2>Uranus is in 00 Degrees: Capricorn.</h2> 
<p>You, and your peer group as well, seek out practical solutions to a changing society's attitudes to customs, traditions and authority structures. Your logical and orderly manner of dealing with these matters will result in permanent and carefully planned, but sweeping, reforms.</p>

<h2>Neptune is in 09 Degrees: Capricorn.</h2> 
<p>You, and your entire generation, will idealize work, practicality and the ability to attain reasonable goals. But, because you will also stress the need to be selfless and giving, you may find it difficult to attain your goals unless you have lowered your expectations on all fronts.</p> 

<h2>Pluto is in	13 Degrees: Scorpio.</h2> 
<p>For your entire generation, this is a period of intense research and discovery in areas that were heretofore considered mysterious, remote or taboo. The root causes for many complex occurrences will be unearthed due to the intensity and thoroughness of the search.</p> 

<h2>N. Node is in 07 Degrees: Pisces.</h2> 
<p>You're attracted to others who need your assistance. You seem to go out of your way to form relationships with those who are weak, sick, injured, addicted or troubled in some way or other. At your best you can indeed provide the relief that others need. But at times you can be victimized by those who would prey on your good nature and take advantage of you. This can lead to all sorts of negative situations -- make sure that those you assist are truly worthy of your time, energy and commitment. A little enlightened self-protectiveness on your part can make your life work much, much smoother!</p>
