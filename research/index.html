	<h2>What do I do?</h2>
	<p>I'm a third year phd student at <a href="https://linguistics.ucla.edu/">UCLA Linguistics</a>. Check out
		<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/colinbr/colinbr.github.io/blob/master/cv/ColinBrownCV2020.pdf">my CV</a> to get a better idea of my research.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Research interests</h2>
	<p>My work focuses on the syntax, semantic, and pragmatics of focus and questions in understudied languages, as well as fieldwork methodology, 
	with specific reference to the critically endangered languages of British Columbia, Canada. 
	Since 2013 I've worked alongside speakers, teachers, and scholars of the Gitksan language, 
	as a member of the <a href="http://lingserver.arts.ubc.ca/linguistics/research/Gitxsan_group">Gitksan Research Lab.</a> 
	In 2018, I started working on Sm'algyax, or Coast Tsimshian.</p>
