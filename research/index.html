	<h2>What do I do?</h2>
	<p>I'm a Ph.D Candidate at <a href="https://linguistics.ucla.edu/">UCLA Linguistics</a>. I am a linguist whose work investigates the interaction between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. That is: how sentences are formed, what they mean, and how they are used in conversation. The foundation of this work is rooted in linguistic fieldwork on understudied languages, namely, Gitksan (Tsimshianic, British Columbia), Sm’algyax (Tsimshianic, British Columbia/Alaska), Bamiléké Dschang (Grassfields Bantu, West Region, Cameroon), and Mam (Mayan, Huehuetenango, Guatemala). The topics I work on include the morphosyntax of questions, relative clauses, and focus; the syntax and semantics of speech acts; and the pragmatics of evidentiality.  Check out
